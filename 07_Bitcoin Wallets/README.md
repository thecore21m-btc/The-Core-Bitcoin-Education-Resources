# 📲 Bitcoin Wallets

We will utilize multiple apps throughout our course. You can click on the links to download each application. Scroll down to the end for additional resources.

## 📢 Important Note
**WE ONLY RECOMMEND BITCOIN WALLETS; WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR MANAGING YOUR FUNDS, ESPECIALLY WHEN USING SELF-CUSTODIAL WALLETS.**

Please understand that with self-custodial wallets, you have full control over your Bitcoin. For custodial wallets, their support team is responsible for any assistance. As a Bitcoin education platform, we are happy to guide you on how to use these wallets through our education program. We highly recommend that you understand the fundamentals of Bitcoin before starting to use any wallets.

We have two main types of Bitcoin wallets: **Custodial** and **Self-Custodial** wallets. 

### ⚠️ Self-Custodial Wallets
When using self-custodial wallets, ensure you store your 12 recovery phrases safely. These phrases are the only way to recover your wallet if you lose your device. If you lose both your device and the 12 recovery phrases, it will be impossible to recover your wallet.

For beginners, it's best to keep everything simple and advance in self-custody as you build your knowledge and confidence in Bitcoin. That said, self-custody is the safest and most secure way to manage your Bitcoin.

Please explore different wallets, as you may need various types for different use cases.

## 🏦 Custodial Wallets
Click the links to download and install the wallets. Follow the provided steps to set up your account. Most custodial wallets require your email or phone number. Once set up, be sure to create your lightning address and enable additional security features like a PIN or biometrics. Should you lose your device, custodial wallets are easy to restore using your login details.

## 🔐 Self-Custodial Wallets
Click the links to download each wallet. Remember, you have full control over your Bitcoin. After downloading and installing the wallet, backup your recovery phrases—they are the only way to recover your wallet if you lose your device. Keep them safe, never share them with anyone, and avoid storing them digitally on your phone. Anyone with access to these phrases can recover your wallet and move your funds. Some non-custodial wallets are best suited for on-chain transactions but may be more complex to set up for lightning. For beginners, it’s advisable to start with custodial wallets until you’re confident in setting up lightning on a self-custodial wallet.
