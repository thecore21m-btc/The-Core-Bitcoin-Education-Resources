> **⚠️ Note:** We only recommend Bitcoin wallets; we are not responsible for managing your funds, especially when using self-custodial wallets. With self-custodial wallets, you have full control over your Bitcoin. For custodial wallets, their support team is responsible for assistance.

As a Bitcoin education platform, we are happy to guide on how to use these wallets through our education program. We highly recommend understanding the fundamentals of Bitcoin before starting to use any wallets.

### 🔍 Types of Bitcoin Wallets

We have two main types of Bitcoin wallets: **Custodial** and **Self-Custodial**.

1. **💼 Custodial Wallets**: The wallet provider holds the private keys to your wallet.
2. **🔒 Self-Custodial Wallets**: You have full control, with only you holding the private keys to manage your Bitcoin.

> **⚠️ Note:** When you fully understand the importance of self-custody, store your 12 recovery phrases safely. These phrases are the only way to recover your wallet if you lose your device. Losing both your device and recovery phrases will make wallet recovery impossible.

For beginners, it's best to keep things simple and advance in self-custody as you build knowledge and confidence in Bitcoin. Self-custody is the safest and most secure way to manage your Bitcoin.
