## Exchanges

Exchanges serve as marketplaces for Bitcoin and often provide their own wallets. These exchanges offer convenience for swiftly buying and selling Bitcoin, though many will require you to complete a KYC (Know Your Customer) process. It's advisable to transfer your purchased Bitcoin from an exchange to a non-custodial wallet, such as the Phoenix wallet mentioned above.
